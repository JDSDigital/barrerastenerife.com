    "title": "UNDERSTANDING THE BUYING PROCESS",
    "description1": "What is the purpose of you buying the property? It is a very important question for you to answer. Is it for personal use, a retirement home or is it a property for investment purposes? Do you want a property in a complex or community or do you want a detached property where there are no community fees to pay? Are you looking to buy a rundown property to refurbish and sell on to make a profit? Is this a short term or long-term investment? Take time to explain to your agent exactly what you are your wishes. This will help your agent to find the right property and will save you all a lot of time. It is absolutely crucial for you to decide which area you are interested in buying a property. If you are buying in a complex or community, you need to bear in mind that there are usually added costs for service charges and community fees to maintain the complex. This will include maintenance on things like gardens, swimming pools, communal areas and lifts etc. You need to find out what the ongoing fees are before you buy so that you can budget your monthly running costs properly. There are some complexes that do not allow short term rentals, so if you are looking to buy an investment property to rent out, make sure that you are allowed to do so prior to buying. If you decide to buy a detached property then you will have to consider things like gardeners, pool maintenance companies that you can use in case you need them, especially if you are away from the property for any length of time, it may be worth considering a trustworthy key-holder. The more time you spend researching and deciding what you are buying the property for, the more time you will save when actually viewing properties.",
    "description2": "Understanding the buying process coupled with the right real estate agent that can provide expert representation and guidance will make all the difference when finding the perfect home.",

    "process1": "Make sure that you have the funds in place to make the purchase. If you need a mortgage to buy your property it is probably a good idea to get mortgage advice prior to searching for a property. This way you will know roughly how much the bank will lend you and that will save you time completing the deal once you have found a property you want to buy. In any case, the bank will have to value the property and will probably lend you a percentage based on the lower figure of either the sales price or the valuation. The percentage will vary per bank but if you are a resident you may get a mortgage of up to 80% of the lower of the two figures and if you are a non-resident you may get up to 60% of the lower of the two figures. If you do not have a mortgage in place when you are searching for a property, you stand the risk of losing the property you want to buy while you are applying for the mortgage. Many owners are not prepared to wait for a buyer to apply for a mortgage, especially if the market is moving fast. You are also in a better position to negotiate a better sale price if you have your funds in place and can make a quick purchase, so speak to your estate agent, bank or financial advisor and get the wheels in motion prior to searching for a property. It could possibly be better for you to apply for a mortgage in your own country first as your own bank knows your history so it could make the process easier for you. You will probably be able to make the monthly payments in your own currency which could also save you money as well by not having to make regular overseas transfers. You should also check with your bank to see if there are any early cancelation fees as this can come as a surprise at the end in case you want to pay off your mortgage early. Check with the bank if you have the option of fixed interest payments as well as variable interest rates. The current rate of interest is very low and it could prove beneficial to you to have a fixed interest rate. If you are taking out a mortgage on your property the bank will probably offer you insurance and tell you that you must take out their insurance cover by law which protects the lender. This is not quite true and they will do this because they get paid commission from the insurance company. It is true that you need an insurance policy in place which covers the mortgage amount to the lender but you are free to choose which insurance company you use. Shop around and get quotes from other companies. If your bank pushes you into taking their insurance policy, it can be expensive so it might be worth cancelling after the first year and taking out another policy with another company",
    "process2": "Get a NIE number. When buying a property in Spain, you are required to apply for a NIE number which is a foreigners identification number. This is normally applied for at the national police station and can be either done by yourself, or with the help of your agent. There is a small cost involved which they will guide you with. You will have to fill in some simple forms and give a copy of your current passport. You will have to pay a small fee at the bank and then go to the national police station to apply for the NIE number. If you are giving your agent a power of attorney to act for you, he/her can normally apply for your NIE on your behalf. You may want to ask your agent for advice on this matter. ",
    "process3": "Open Spanish bank account. You will need to open a Spanish bank account before you buy a property so that you can transfer the money for making the purchase as well as setting up standing orders for utility bills after the purchase, things like water, rubbish, Ibi (property tax) and electricity as well as things like property insurance and local property rates etc. Your agent can help you with this process and maybe recommend a good bank. We recommend that you use a bank that has a branch near the property you are thinking of buying so that you can pop in to speak to them in person should you need to do. There are of course online banks but we do not recommend them, especially if you are looking for a mortgage. It can be hard work trying to deal with things over the phone or via email. This of course is a personal choice and something that you will have to decide on. You will need your passport or ID card and will be required to prove that you are legally able to open an account and will be asked to provide proof of income. The exact requirements may vary from bank to bank and you will have to discuss this with staff at the bank. If you can find a bank that speaks your language then this will help you. It will also help if they have an easy-to-use online banking system so that you can process online transactions if needed.",
    "process4": "When buying a property, you should always negotiate the price and your estate agent will do this for you. In some cases, the vendors put a price on their property that they expect they will have to drop slightly in order to make the sale, so do not be afraid to negotiate. Your estate agent is accustomed to negotiating and knows how it should be done properly. They are there to liaise between buyer and seller and take out the personal involvement. They will have plenty of experience and will probably get the best possible deal for all parties involved. Please bear in mind that in any negotiation, it should always be a win/win situation whereby all parties involved are happy.",
    "process5": "When you have found the property, you want to buy, you will normally be required to pay a deposit to secure the sale which is usually 10% of the sale price. You must be absolutely certain that you can continue with the sale because this deposit is usually non-refundable so you will normally lose it if you back out of the sale. If the vendor backs out of the sale, they should pay you a penalty of the same amount as the deposit you paid. The average timescale for a sales agreement is 60 days from paying the deposit, although this is something that can be flexible depending on the buyer’s and seller’s circumstances. There is usually a fifteen-day leeway at the end of the contract just in case there are any unforeseen problems that need resolving to be able to complete the sale.",
    "process6": "When buying a property, you must make sure that it has an escritura and that the property is registered at the land registry office. This will all be checked out by your agent or legal advisor. On the day that you sign for the property it will be done at the notaries office. This is when the final payment must be made to the vendors and you get the keys for your new property. You will have to prove where your money has come from to make the purchase so you should make the payment by either a banker’s draft or a bank transfer. If the vendor has a mortgage on the property, it is normal practice that part of the payment is made directly to their bank in order to cancel their mortgage. If this is the case make sure that your legal advisor sees that the mortgage cancelation is registered with the land registry and that the vendor pays for this to be done. If the vendors have any outstanding debts, they might be retained from the funds you pay them to make sure that they are paid. Your agent or advisor should be there with you and you should have the escritura translated properly to you so that you fully understand what you are signing. You will need to take your passport and NIE number. The notary will verify that you are who you say you are and that the details in the title deeds are correct before they allow you to sign.",
    "process7": "Once the escritura has been signed it has to be registered in the land registry in your name and this will be done by your legal advisor. It can take about 30 to 45 days and once it has been done, you should be given an original copy along with any invoices for costs incurred. You can however ask for a photocopy (copia simple) of the title deeds on the day of the signing. This is normal procedure and can only take about 15 minutes after the signing. ",
    "process8": "The extra costs involved in buying which are on top of the actual purchase price. These costs can add up to about 10% in total but the higher the price of the property, the percentage drops slightly due to the fixed fees involved. At the moment of writing this document, the stamp duty (ITP or IGIC) on buying a second-hand property is 6.5% and 7% on a purchase of newbuilt property which is quite a big addition to the price. Apart from this you will also have to pay the notary fees, land register fees and your legal advisors fees. All these payments are normally made on the day of the signing of the escritura so you will need to have the funds in place. Make sure that you get a full breakdown of costs from your agent or legal advisor prior to completing the sale so that there are no surprises after the purchase has been made. Make sure that you keep all the receipts for all the costs incurred in buying your property because these can be off set against any profit you may have when you eventually come to sell the property again in the future.",
    "process9": "If you are considering renting out your property, please make sure that you can do this legally and use a proper agent to do this for you. If the property is in a complex, you may need to go through the complex reception if they have the sole management rights."

    "title": "UNDERSTANDING THE SELLING PROCESS",
    "description": "Selling your home is, at once, an exciting and challenging time. Being as informed as possible about the selling process, will bring you the best results, with the least stress possible. Here, we outline what you can expect from selling your home as we detail the real estate selling process. Empowered with this information, you can manage your expectations, your workload, and your timelines to ensure a smooth selling process and successful results.",

    "process1": "Do you really want to sell your property?  Make sure that you think this through first before making the decision so that you don’t waste your time and that of others. There are obviously many reasons behind such a decision, but if it is only due to lack of funds, you might even consider renting it out to help with the running costs until your situation changes. It is worth having a chat with your agent to see what other options are available for you.",
    "process2": "List your property at a correct price. A lot of owners believe that their property is worth more than it actually is because they have spent money on it renovating or decorating it to their preferred style. In majority of cases this means absolutely nothing to a potential buyer who will most likely have completely different taste to yours. Your local agent can make a correct evaluation based on experience empowered by official price statistics for this kind of property in this specific area. You can also opt for an official valuation which can cost around three to four hundred Euros or more, depending on the value of your property. You do not want because you got it wrong. Listing your property at a high price and then have to start reducing it might give to potential buyers the impression that you are desperate to sell. ",
    "process3": "It is really important that your agent has a good online presence and marketing strategy. As well as their own professional and user-friendly website they should be advertising on a number of property portals like Thinkspain, Kyero, Fotocasa, Idealista and Pisos.com and etc. They should be using at least a couple of them to get your property seen internationally by as many potential foreign buyers as possible. Find an agent that works in collaboration with a wide range of other agents. There are lots of potential buyers from all over the world. You should be making sure that your property is being offered to these potential foreign buyers via a good network of international agents. You will not have to physically deal with any of the other agents, because your main agent will do all of this for you. If your agent sells your property via one of their collaborators, they will have to split their fees with them which does not cost you any more money, but is another reason why they will want full commission in order to make it attractive to their network of collaborators. ",
    "process4": "Don’t waste time thinking and worrying about how much the agent is going to make out of the sale. Stay focused on the end result, which is selling your property in the timescale you want, and achieving a fair price. There is an old saying that states that cheap things often end up being expensive in the long run, and this is the same for your agency fees. Agency fees may vary from agency to agency, but the going rate for a professional agency is 5% plus IGIC, which is the Canary equivalent to VAT or IVA. Most estate agents work on a “no sale, no fee” basis as well, which means that if they don’t sell your property, it will not cost you anything.",
    "process5": "When you sell a property there are various costs involved as you can imagine, and here is a quick look into what they are. Your estate agents’ fees are usually 5% plus IGIC (7%) which is the Canary Islands’ equivalent to VAT. Your agent must give you an official invoice for this which you can then give to your accountant to deduct from your possible capital gains tax. A law that was introduced in 2013, stating that in order for you to sell or rent out a property, you have to have a valid energy performance certificate (certificado eficiencia energetica). If you do not have one, you will need to get one done which can cost around 150€ depending on the size of your property. Your agent will be able to help you arrange this. A local tax to pay to your local town hall which is called Plus Valía (Impuesto sobre el incremento del valor de los terrenos). In the past, there was some confusion about who had to pay it, but it is the obligation of the seller to pay for it and not the buyer as some people wrongly believe. This has nothing to do with your income tax or capital gains. You can request a simulation of the amount of Plus valia Municipal in your local town hall. ",
    "process6": "If you are a resident in Spain, you must declare the sale of your property to the tax office when you submit your tax returns for that fiscal year. The current rate of capital gains tax is 19%. You should be able to offset many of the costs involved in buying and selling the property as well as any refurbishments you have made providing you have official invoices and proof of payment. Your tax advisor will inform you in more detail about this. ",
    "process7": "If you are a non-resident, it works differently. On the day you sell the property you will have to pay a non-residents tax of 3% based on the sale price. This is normally retained from you by the buyers on the day you sign the escritura. Their legal advisor will then pay this to the tax office on your behalf and give you proof of payment. This amount will then be deducted from any potential capital gains tax you may have to pay in the future. Make sure that you speak to your financial or tax advisor regarding capital gains tax to make sure you get the correct and up to date information. If you sell your property and want to move the funds back to your country of residence, your bank will most likely want to charge you for transferring the funds. Your agent can help you to negotiate a bank commission. ",
    "process8": "What documents do you need? In order to sell your property, you will need a series of documents and if you already have them ready, it will help to make the sales process run smoothly. You don’t need them all when you first put the property on the market, but it is a good idea for you to have them ready. When you place your property for sale, your agent will want to see a copy of the escritura so that they can verify who the current owner or owners are and other necessary details in order to prepare for the future sale of your property. If you have a mortgage on the property, you should tell your agent, they might ask you for a copy of your last mortgage payment. You will need to have copies of your passports or identity cards as well as NIE numbers especially when it comes to preparing the private sales agreement. An up-to-date energy performance certificate will be required on the day of signing the escritura. Your agent can help you with this. You should also prepare copies of recent utility bills like water, electricity, rubbish. Even though you don’t need them until the property is sold, you should have them at hand just in case the potential buyers ask for details of the running costs. On the day you sign over the property at the notary, you will have to provide an up-to-date community certificate signed by the administrator and/ or president, stating that you don’t have any outstanding debts to the community. Another important document you must have is proof of payment of IBI for the current year. This is payable once a year, between May and July, but runs from the 1st January until the 31st of December. Some people are not sure who is liable for this, but it is very simple. Whoever owns the property on the 1st of January is responsible for paying the IBI for the entire year. Your agent should give you a check list of all the necessary documents needed and will tell you where you need to go to get them. ",
    "process9": "Once your agent has someone interested in your property, the potential buyers will have to pay a non-refundable deposit except for situations in which both parties accept the clause that stipulates the return of the deposit (for example, in case of buyers that obtain for a mortgage loan). The deposit is normally ten percent of the sale price in order to secure the sale. You would then sign a private sales agreement with the buyers which your agent will arrange. A final date is included in the agreement stipulating when you would sign the escritura at the notaries office. That is when the title deeds to the property are signed over to the buyer, they become the new owners, and you get paid. The timescale for a sale to take place can vary, but as a general rule it can take around six to eight weeks from receiving the deposit and signing the private sales agreement. This can of course be quicker or slower depending on the circumstances of both parties. The deposit will normally be held in your agent’s or seller’s bank account. It can even be lodged with the notary in their bank account but there would be an additional charge for this service. The is a clause in the contract that says if the buyer backs out of the sale, they lose the deposit and the money goes to the seller. If the seller backs out of the deal, the deposit will be paid back to the buyer and they can legally claim the equivalent amount as compensation from the seller. (For example. If they paid twenty thousand deposit, they will get that back and can then claim another twenty thousand as compensation from the seller) It is normal practice to include a written or photographic inventory of the furniture and everything else that is staying in the property when you sell it. This would be an annex to the sales agreement and will be signed by both parties. It is also normal practice for the buyer to visit the property on the day of the signing to make sure everything is left as agreed. The contract will also state each parties’ liabilities and commitments regarding the purchase. Make sure that you fully understand the content of the contract and that you know what you are signing. Your agent will gladly go over everything with you to explain things and answer any questions you might have. ",
    "process10": "Your property must be completely free of debts and occupants on the day that you sign over the title deeds (escritura) to the buyers. These debts include things like, taxes, utility bills, community charges if they apply, including any sinking funds (derramas) as well as any local authority bills like rates and plus valia taxes. However, a debts amount can be retained at the notary by the buyers in order to pay it on sellers’ behalf. Cancelling your mortgage If you have one on your property is normally done at the notary on the same day you sign over the property and is a straightforward process that your agent will help you with. Once you know the exact signing day, you will need to ask your bank for a mortgage cancelation certificate which basically tells you how much you owe them on the date of the signing, it will include any early cancelation fees. If the signing date changes for any reason you will have to get another certificate. On the day of the signing, the buyer will bring a banker’s draft for the amount you owe made out to the name of your bank. The mortgage cancelation has to be registered at the land registry. It is in the new owners’ interest that the mortgage cancellation gets registered straight away. There is a small charge for doing this which you will have to pay for. The normal procedure is that the buyer retains a sum of money from the proceeds of the sale and their legal advisor will make sure the mortgage cancelation gets registered.",
    "process11": "On the day you sign the escritura, you will sign your property over to the buyers and you get paid. The signing takes place before a Notary Public who will witness the transaction. You will have to take your original NIE and passport or ID card to show the Notary at the time of signing. Your agent and legal advisor should be present at the signing to look after you and they will have made sure that all the necessary documents are in place and have been checked over. We have already mentioned which documents you need for the signing in a previous section of this guide. Your agent and legal advisor will have submitted all the details to the notary prior to the signing date so that the draft of the escritura can be prepared prior to your appointment. You will be shown the draft of the escritura which will be in Spanish, and it should be translated to you if you do not speak the language so that you fully understand what you are signing. It is important that you ask for a copy, or “copia simple” of the escritura that you have just signed.",
